# Diabetes-Prediction-with-KNN-Using-Scikit-Learn
This repository implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using Scikit-Learn to predict the onset of diabetes. The model utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
